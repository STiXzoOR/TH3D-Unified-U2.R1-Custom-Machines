**TH3D Unified Firmware with changes for my custom machines**

This firmware is NOT maintained by TH3D. This is meant to be a personal fork/branch that will never be merged back to TH3D Unified Firmware.

It uses a separate configuration file which provides me the ability to make my own custom changes while merging in upstream TH3D firmware updates that support future TH3D products.
